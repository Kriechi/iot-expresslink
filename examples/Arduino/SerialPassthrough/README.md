## Serial Passthrough

This example is simply a way to pass commands through an SparkFun RedBoard Turbo Arduino host board to the ExpressLink.  This makes manually interacting with the ExpressLink attached to an Arduino host very simple.  Use this sketch to explore the commands and perform one-time configurations such as the SSID/Passphrase for WiFi.

Instructions on how to set up the RedBoard Turbo in Arduino IDE can be found [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/redboard-turbo-hookup-guide).
